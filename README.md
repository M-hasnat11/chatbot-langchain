# Chat App

A simple chat application built with Python. This app allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by natural language processing (NLP).

## Features

- User input is processed by the chatbot.
- Responses are generated based on predefined responses or AI logic.
- Easy to customize and extend for different use cases.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. If you haven't already set up a virtual environment, follow the steps below:

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Linux/macOS:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(venv)`).

### Install Dependencies

This project requires certain Python packages. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file.

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the necessary packages for the project, such as `nltk`, `flask`, etc.

## Running the Chat Application

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the chatbot application using:
python chat-app.py

This will start the chatbot, and you’ll be able to interact with it through the terminal.

### Example Interaction

Welcome to the Chatbot!
Type 'exit' to quit.
User: Hi, chatbot!
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
User: Tell me a joke.
Bot: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!
User: exit
Bot: Goodbye!
